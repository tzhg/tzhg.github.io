Representative people
In order to summarise the income distribution in a simple and accessible way,
I decided to compare the incomes of 3 "representative" people.
I chose the three quantiles for alpha=1/6, alpha=1/2, and alpha=5/6.


Challenges

- Different number formats
- Sensitive to outliers - quantiles of population
